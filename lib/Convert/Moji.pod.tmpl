=head1 NAME

Convert::Moji - objects to convert alphabets

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% example("rot13") %]

=head1 VERSION

This documents [% info.colon %] version [% info.version %]
corresponding to git commit L<[% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo
%]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Convert::Moji objects convert between different alphabets. For
example, a Convert::Moji object can convert between Greek letters and
the English alphabet, or convert between phonetic symbols in Unicode
and a representation of them in ASCII.

This started as a helper module for L<Lingua::JA::Moji>, where it is
used for converting between various Japanese methods of writing. It
was split out of that module to be a general-purpose converter for any
alphabets.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 new

    my $convert = Convert::Moji->new (["table", $mytable]);

Create the object. The arguments are a list of array references, one
for each conversion.

Conversions can be chained together:

    my $does_something = Convert::Moji->new (["table", $mytable],
					     ["tr", $left, $right]);

The array references must have one of the following keywords as their
first argument.

=over

=item table

After this comes one more argument, a reference to the hash containing
the table. For example

[% example("crazyhash") %]

The hash keys and values can be any length.

=item file

After this comes one more argument, the name of a file containing some
information to convert into a hash table. The file format is
space-separated pairs, no comments or blank lines allowed. If the file
does not exist or cannot be opened, the module prints an error
message, and returns the undefined value.

=item code

After this comes one or two references to subroutines. The first
subroutine is the conversion and the second one is the inversion
routine. If you omit the second routine, it is equivalent to
specifying "oneway".

=item tr

After this come two arguments, the left and right hand sides of a "tr"
expression, for example

     Convert::Moji->new (["tr", "A-Z", "a-z"])

will convert upper to lower case. A "tr" is performed, and inversely
for the invert case.

=back

Conversions, via "convert", will be performed in the order of the
arguments to new. Inversions will be performed in reverse order of the
arguments, skipping uninvertibles.

=head3 Uninvertible operations

If your conversion doesn't actually go backwards, you can tell the
module when you create the object using a keyword "oneway":

    my $uninvertible = Convert::Moji->new (["oneway", "table", $mytable]);

Then the method C<$uninvertible->invert> doesn't do anything. You can
also selectively choose which operations of a list are invertible and
which aren't, so that only the invertible ones do something.

=head3 Load from a file

To load a character conversion table from a file, use

Convert::Moji->new (["file", $filename]);

In this case, the file needs to contain a space-separated list of
items to be converted one into the other, such as

    alpha α
    beta β
    gamma γ

The file reading cannot handle comments or blank lines in the
file. Examples of use of this format are L<Lingua::JA::Moji/kana2hw>,
L<Lingua::JA::Moji/circled2kanji>, and
L<Lingua::JA::Moji/bracketed2kanji>.

=head2 convert

After building the object, it is used to convert text with the
"convert" method. The convert method takes one argument, a scalar
string to be converted by the rules we specified with L</new>.

This ignores (passes through) characters which it can't convert.

=head2 invert

This inverts the input.

This takes two arguments. The first is the string to be inverted back
through the conversion process, and the second is the type of
conversion to perform if the inversion is ambiguous. This can take one
of the following values

=over

=item first

If the inversion is ambiguous, it picks the first one it finds.

=item random

If the inversion is ambiguous, it picks one at random.

=item all

In this case you get an array reference back containing either strings
where the inversion was unambiguous, or array references to arrays
containing all possible strings.

=item all_joined

Like "all", but you get a scalar with all the options in square
brackets instead of lots of array references.

=back

The second argument part is only implemented for hash table based
conversions, and is very likely to be buggy even then.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

These are helper functions for the module.

=head2 length_one

    # Returns false:
    length_one ('x', 'y', 'monkey');
    # Returns true:    
    length_one ('x', 'y', 'm');

Returns true if every element of the array has a length equal to one,
and false if any of them does not have length one. The L</make_regex>
function uses this to decide whether to use a C<[abc]> or a C<(a|b|c)>
style regex.

=head2 make_regex

    my $regex = make_regex (qw/a b c de fgh/);

    # $regex = "fgh|de|a|b|c";

Given a list of strings, this makes a regular expression which matches
any of the strings in the list, longest match first. Each of the
elements of the list is quoted using C<quotemeta>. The regular
expression does not contain capturing parentheses. 

To convert everything in string C<$x> from the keys of C<%foo2bar> to
its values,

[% example("trombone") %]

For more examples, see the "joke" program at
L<Data::Kanji::Kanjidic/english>, or L<this example
program|https://www.lemoda.net/perl/make-romaji/make-romaji.pl> which
converts Japanese kanji words into romaji using the output of Mecab.

=head2 unambiguous

    my $invertible = unambiguous (\%table));

Returns true if all of the values in C<%table> are distinct, and false
if any two of the values in C<%table> are the same. This is used by
L</invert> to decide whether a table can be reversed.
